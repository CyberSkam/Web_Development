            <li>Animals are sentient beings and don't deserve our mistreatment, because they too want to live!</li>
            <li>Animal agriculture causes 51% of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, compared to vehicular pollution, which is only responsible for 30% of air pollution.
            </li>

            <h1>I want my mom! :(</h1>
            <li>Overbreeding of animals for man's use has caused more requirement of agriculture land, resulting in deforestation.</li>
            <li>Male calves are killed at birth or after a few weeks because they are not of any use to the industry, while female calves are separated from their mothers and grow up to be the same. </li>
            <li>Veganism is sustainable for all stages of life , from infancy to old-age. Saturated fat, predominantly present in animal products causes heart disease, which is the number 1 killer of humans</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
           <i>Going vegan is not a diet change, but a way of life and also a moral obligation for all human beings if we want to see this planet survive for many more years.</i>
